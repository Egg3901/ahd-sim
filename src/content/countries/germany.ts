// GERMANY — two Bundestag elections, one bundle.
//
// 2025 (the 21st Bundestag, February 23, 2025): 630 seats under the reformed
// (fully proportional) electoral law; 316 for a majority. Real result as the
// calibration anchor: Union 208, AfD 152, SPD 120, Greens 85, Linke 64, SSW 1 —
// FDP and BSW under the 5% threshold (both live inside `oth` here).
//
// 2021 (the 20th Bundestag, September 26, 2021): 735 seats with overhang and
// leveling mandates; 368 for a majority. Anchor: SPD 206, Union 197, Grüne 118,
// FDP 92, AfD 83, Linke 39. The FDP is its own (playable) party in this cycle —
// the engine only offers parties present in an election's region data, so FDP
// appears in 2021 and stays folded into `oth` in 2025.
//
// Seat elasticity is 1.0: proportional representation moves seats one-for-one
// with vote share. Each election's `s` tables define its own region pools, so
// the 735-seat chamber lives beside the 630-seat one.

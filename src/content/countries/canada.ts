// CANADA — federal elections. Real results baked in as calibration anchors.
// 2025 (April 28): 343 seats, 172 for a majority — LPC 169, CPC 145, BQ 22,
// NDP 6, GRN 1 (Carney's tariff-war comeback over Poilievre).
// 2021 (September 20): 338 seats, 170 for a majority — LPC 160, CPC 119, BQ 32,
// NDP 25, GPC 2 (Trudeau's pandemic snap call buys back the same minority).

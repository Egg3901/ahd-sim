# Margin of Victory

Margin of Victory is a single-player, turn-based election campaign simulator with 49
election scenarios across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany,
France, and Australia. Its scenarios span 1951 to 2027 and model each country's
electoral system, parties, regions, and campaign pressures.

> You are the campaign manager. Read the map, allocate finite resources each
> week, answer the moments that matter, and rewrite the result.

Play in the browser at
[lakesidegames.net/games/electioneer](https://lakesidegames.net/games/electioneer/).
The existing `/games/electioneer/` address and internal `electioneer` product
identifier remain unchanged so existing links, purchases, and saves keep working.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
npm run calibrate
npm run build
```

The browser game runs as a React SPA. Local campaigns are stored in IndexedDB.
The optional Node server provides accounts, leaderboards, entitlement checks,
activation codes, and cloud-facing platform integration.

## Architecture

The simulation core is kept separate from the interface. `src/engine` is pure
TypeScript with no React, DOM, or browser dependencies, so it can run in the
browser, in the Tauri desktop shell, in tests, or headless for calibration.

```

The United States engine models state polling, demographic blocs, electoral
votes, campaign actions, events, debates, and an AI opponent. Country adapters
extend the same campaign loop to parliamentary, proportional, preferential,
and runoff systems. Every game is seedable, which supports reproducible tests,
daily challenges, replay, and balance simulations.

## Content and calibration

The scenario registry is the source of truth for the current 49 elections.
Historical scenarios use authored candidates, starting conditions, maps, and
events. Calibration suites check that neutral play remains close to historical
baselines while still allowing campaign decisions to change the outcome.

## Product identity

The player-facing name is Margin of Victory. Compatibility-sensitive identifiers such
as the package name, desktop application identifier, entitlement game key,
database records, backup paths, and checkout query value remain `electioneer`.
Do not rename those without a coordinated data and deployment migration.
